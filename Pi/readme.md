Ah the life of Pi...O you meant the Raspberry pie...
MHM..

(ARM-HF build)

It is **quite possible** to use this for classroom Pi experimentation.
Move over scratch and claw-here comes "Sammie the Turtle" with re-implemented TURTLE Graphix 2.0!
(I bet you C devs never bothered with THIS!)


The code isnt there yet- but we are not off by a whole lot.

As I said- VB, (maybe Basic thru qb64) and Python ports are possible..
maybe even from me.
