## Why WHYE ..WHY..

Why freePascal?

		-Full 16, 256, RGB, and RGBA support (256BPP?) up thru 1080p.

		-TCanvas for Laz doesnt quite do the job.
		-Lazarus jumps from TCanvas(half-assed) to OpenSceneGraph and busted GL.
		
		-GVision for Linux (Pascal version of Win311) never took off. 
		-JEDI doesnt stand for what you think it does- its incomplete, missing, and now depreciated.
		-Because Delphi is windows only (and non portable)
		
		-Castle engine is good, BUT requires OpenGL (and Lazarus) knowhow.
			(You probly dont- know- the how)
			
		-Lazarus is turning into OOP OBJ customized UnFreePascal, much like VC did.
				Code is either for FPC -- or its not.
			
		-This isnt a "class project", its my passion. Im not rushing my work.
		-Nobody uses Int10 DOS assembler anyore. 
		-This is 32/64 bits code. I dont write "8bit hacks".

        -FreePascal "Graphics support" is missing (or broken)
        -Lazarus OGL demos DO NOT work (correctly).

        -Code has been abandoned. 
        -Code that used to work- suddenly isnt working.

(This appears to be a "shader sequence" or Perspective problem.)


There are loads of projects where people cannot revise changes publicly.
Programmers are making it more difficult with mailing lists (spam) and "private repos".

        This isnt the 1990s. 
        USE GITHUB. 
        USE TRAC(or similar). 
        COLABORATE.

A lot of other code is half-assed or broken.
People suffer from information overload and cant figure things out.
 
For the code to be useful, it must be in library format.
SDL doesnt do enough- however- it points us to a common codebase and UNIVERsalITY.

If you call an SDL function- you call it the same way 

	in other languages
	on other platforms or OSes

The developers dont care to fix problems.
        
        THIS IS BAD.

Shoving people into SDL and saying "good luck"-
		
	When theres 50 ways to do things...IS WRONG.


Need Graphics libraries for DOS/FreeDOS??

	Try the original BGI written by Borland, INC.
	The BGI has been 256 color extended - I have the patch.
        HDMIx loader (and SDL) MAY work- and then again, so might PTC unit.
