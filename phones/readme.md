On-The-Go code isnt here yet. Sorry. You need Android Studio at the 
least.

Its an awesome bundle of an application.
I build my first demo in under 45 minutes-mostly waiting on downloads 
and APKs to install.It took me less than 5min to build an app- and 
virtually test it.

ADB tools are available for hacking your droid-side loading apps
(signed or otherwise) etc. The tools are stable enough to use.

Im just not here yet.


MCCrapple wants to own the VC and OBJC with the iFruits and doesnt allow
apps in the store and breathes funny on people trying to link into 
the VC and OBJC they provide for iFruit programming.

O-you can use SDL- but only with THIER routines, not in Pascal.

THIS IS WRONG. As such I will not support the iFruits.

Sorry. NOT MY FAULT.
