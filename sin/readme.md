You need MinGW or Visual Studio to build this in Windows.

If using the Linux terminal avilable in  Sin10 PLEN-TEN-IAL edition, you may find it easier to keep up with me.
If you arent, you are missing "Linux in Windows".

You need FPC to build, Lazarus is optional.
Keep everything in one folder for now.
