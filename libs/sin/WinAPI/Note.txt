This seems to be SDL v1[BitBlits era] and (windows only) OpenGL 2.0 era.
Vista was coming out when this code was written- so 
resonably XP functions may not have been added.

OpenGl is probed- but I dont see any OGL routines in here.

By these standards we could dick around w X11 core lib routines all day as well.(why?)
Code may not be thread safe, nor 64 bit.

OpenGl demo has a scene glitch in it. Ive experienced similar with the Tri/Pyramid demo- but I fixed it.
(One of the vectors is off somewhere- so the app goes nuts. It mighta-usta-worked back in the day.)

3D is the only code Ive seen that uses OGL- or needed to.

OGL can do 2D- if you know how (GLUT/freeGLUT makes input and else easier, too)


seems all we need(if that) is the Windows unit (on Windows-fancy that...)
