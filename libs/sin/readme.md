You need Lazarus to build this in Windows.
For C apps: you need MingGW installed or Centeniial+Bash installed or MSVC installed

If using the Linux terminal avilable in  Sin10 PLEN-TEN-IAL edition, you may find it easier to keep up with me.
If you arent, you are missing "Linux in Windows". MingGW helps.

You need FPC to build, Lazarus is optional.
Keep everything in one folder for now.
