unit redbook;

{
The closest reference I can give for this is:

1- a CDPlayer in Pascal
2- SEGA CD or Descent II based games(RedBook Audio)

This is the audio portion..not the game code...

need to use uos, not SDL.
Fpc provides bare minimal basics, uos expands on them.

lincd unit (cdrom.h) is what most Games with RedBook audio need(or mimic).
