# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

As a contributor you agree to abide by these "RULES".
(This is not a holloween joke- this IS intentionally written this way)


## Our Pledge

We pledge a harassment free environment based only on your federal rights of nondiscrimination because you have a religion(or not), might be LBGT (or Q), might be disabled, might be a veteran, etc etc etc. This is all we promise.

There is no guarantee we will not take your unicorn to the monn without asking.
This is not a pussy-footed comminuty, and the efforts to make it one are REJECTED, REBUTTED and REFUSED.

Welcome to CUTTHROAT PROGRAMMING. Where only the BEST CODE MATTERS. (Sorry, this is the reality that you code in.)

Just shut up and code.
I dont care what your cat thinks about me, or what you think about my (our) attitude.

## Our Standards

The following is an INSTA-BAN:

* Trolling, or deeply derogatory or perverted comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private ongoing harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission

"Troll slaying" is perfectly legal.
We dont care which policical side you pick, even if its the wrong one. YOu are HERE TO-CODE.

You are expected to grow a spine and thick skin. If you cant handle this- LEAVE NOW.

You are expected to know how to write reasonable code, if not Objective (something). While C isnt used here,
   the methods can be spot on if applied in Pascal/FPC/OBJ-Pascal.

If you cant code, go learn. This is not the place for you.
(even if working on your bachelors degree)

People expect results and you WILL give them results. If caught not giving results, you will be asked to leave.
This includes a REASONABLE bug report.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem unworthy or threatening.

There is no recourse for "foaming at the mouth", however, if your life isnt being threatened and the text isnt perverted, the claim will probably be denied.

We dont bend over backwards for insults. We openly expect them - in a programming style and mannerism.
If this offends you, LEAVE.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of  unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at justemailme@southernhedgehogs.bit. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident, hoever, this does not guarantee it.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

### Summary:

The main goal is NOT TO SCREW UP by targeting, HAZING, or HARASSING people.
Really I dont care about the other BS- its fruitcake language for:

    "WE DONT DISCRIMINATE INTENTIONALLY."

I will however, point out your mistakes as a programmer- as Ive probly been doing this longer than you.
THIS ISNT COLLEGE HOMEWORK.
THIS IS MY/OUR PASSION.
