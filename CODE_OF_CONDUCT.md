# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

As a contributor you agree to abide by these "RULES".
(This is not a halloween joke- this IS intentionally written this way)


## Our Pledge

We pledge a harassment free environment based only on your federal rights of nondiscrimination 
because you have a religion(or not), might be LBGT (or Q), might be disabled, might be a veteran, etc etc etc. 

This is all we promise.

There is no guarantee we will not take your unicorn to the moon without asking.
This is not a pussy-footed comminuty, and the efforts to make it one are REJECTED, REBUTTED and REFUSED.

This is not a complaint department. That section is for code issues.


Welcome to CUTTHROAT PROGRAMMING. 
Where only the BEST CODE MATTERS. 
(Sorry, this is the reality that you code in.)

"People bitch, whine, and complain...but if the code doesnt accomplish the mission...yer outta here"
"Feel free to try the FAILURE ROUND -where you can buy back your place- once youve caught up."

Just shut up and code.
I dont care what your cat thinks about me, or what you think about my (our) attitude.
Keep that non-sence on your social feed. Quite Frankly- I dont think it belongs THERE.

## Our Standards

The following is an INSTA-BAN:

* Trolling, or deeply derogatory or perverted comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private ongoing harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* STEALING CODE without proper citations(plagarism)

        I personally make every attempt to avoid this. Some things are not fully documented. 

"Troll slaying" is perfectly legal.
We dont care which policical side you pick, even if its the wrong one. 
Express your views somewhere else.

You are HERE TO-CODE.

You are expected to grow a spine and thick skin. If you cant handle this- LEAVE NOW.

You are expected to know how to write reasonable code, if not Objective (something). 
While C isnt used here, the methods can be spot on if applied in Pascal/FPC/OBJ-Pascal.

        If you cant code, this is not the place for you.
        This is not the place for your BS level Homework or MS level project.
        This is not the the place for your HS project.
        This is not the place for your 4H project.

THIS IS REAL CODE for the REAL WORLD.
KEEP UP or GET RUNOVER by REAL PROGRAMMERS.

THIS IS NOT A SOCIAL CLUB. 
I dont care how many billions of comments and likes you have.
I dont care how many friends you have or people you follow online.


People expect results and you WILL give them results. 
If caught not giving results, you will be asked to leave.
This includes a REASONABLE bug report.

I dont know wtf to do with a strack trace- never really have....so dont leave me one.
Find me the offending unit and line number instead.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected 
to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, 
commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, 
or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem unworthy or threatening.

There is no recourse for "foaming at the mouth". If this is some awkward attempt to get back at those
because you dont know how to properly write code- YOU CAN LEAVE.


## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual 
is representing the project or its community. 

Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, 
posting via an "official" NON-PERSONAL social media account, 
or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. 

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at 
justemailme@southernhedgehogs.bit. 

The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way 
that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. 

The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to 
the reporter of an incident, hoever, this does not guarantee it.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith 
may face temporary or permanent BANS as determined by members of the project's leadership(Mr. Jasmin).
