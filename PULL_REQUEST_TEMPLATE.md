Just fork it and give me what you have back in a pull request.<br>
I only accept FPC code- I will not merge your C/CPP/OBJ-C, translate it first.

FPC pascal syntax or "IFDEFINED" OBJ-Pascal ONLY.<br>
NO Delphi, its not cross-platform. It doesnt "port well".

I will take TP/BP code- if the assembler instructions have been removed and rewritten.<br>
-You need to update this for 32 and 64 bit Compilers, environments, and CPUs.

I will not take 8bit or 16bit math -UNLESS its for the i8088 FPC port.
