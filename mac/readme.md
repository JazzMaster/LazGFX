McQuacking at me already?

Im not using my Apple right now--
Sorry.

You need XCode and SDL installed. I can give you the files- but you need to install them.
You need FPC and you need it setup. You dont need XCODE. XCODE pulls in the build-essential side of 
things for the Mac. That is the only reason that you need XCODE installed(besides wanting to build Lazarus apps yourself).
