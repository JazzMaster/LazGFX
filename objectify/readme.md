You can have TCanvas(very limited and broken) or you can have OpenGLContext "in a window".
There isnt even a Fullscreen mode! (what rubbish is this!)

Lazarus routines are CRAP! AYE AYE AYE! (why do I even bother?)<br>
Give me the units- give me the units in one place--lets have 100s of units called....(for one routine each)

This package system BREAKS the IDE!
