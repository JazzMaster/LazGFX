unit physics;

{
This can be two-fold:

1- game engine dynamics (usually what it refers to)
2- reality physics and math, like nVidia engine draws (where this unit should be aiming)

that said on #2:

There may be advanced driver functions that we can utilize once SDL is up (in 3D) to render with
to speed our code up. Vulkan is one example. PhysX by nVidia is the other. Most require GL I belive.

The unit will take some heavy research.
However, without this unit games will be lacking severely.

This unit should handle:

SPRITE COLLISIONS

Plasma
Fire
Water
Hair or fur
Wind effects (moving fur, grasses)
SunSpots and Flares

I might be able to gleam some info from Super Mario (original code stolen by nintendo) from BP7.
