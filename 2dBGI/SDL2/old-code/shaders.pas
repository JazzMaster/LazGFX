unit shaders;

{

This is where the nitty gritty hair raising(code-wise) 3d scenes come into play.
A shader is like a bitmask of intense color that gives plain jane 3d objects in the computer realm
Realistic coloring and lighting(T and L).

It also provides one other function.
What does the object look like besides a drab boring piece of fuzzy color?

NO NO NO -you want details like wood grain, porous-ness, bubbles, bumps..

This is the idea behind what a 3Dtexture is but in SDL texture is defined as a "surface to render onto".
-Like a transparent overhead sheet.

So we need more code...and a lot of time in (blender? makeHuman?) and the "game design" process.

Objects(3d) or textures(flat) are supposed to provide these details to us but we need to know how to load and render them.
I will attempt to use open-source variants where possible.
