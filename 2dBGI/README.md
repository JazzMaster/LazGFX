## BGI Notes


#### Windows Minimum version 

DirectDraw has been scrapped. <br>
We will be stopping compatibility at Win 2K.

Windows 2K can use DirectX9c.<br>
WIn 2K is Pre-XP. XP has been around forever.<br>
Win2K doesnt suffer from "activation bugs"-that service didnt exist yet.


There is no reason to go below this- these OSes are very insecure - if they can ever surf the net.<br>


#### Win 95 and 98

Win 95/98 (DirectX 5 era) cannot connect to the "modern web" -choke on cryptography and algorithms, and 
do not thave the resources required to load sites like facebook. (often have less than 128MB ram)

Keep in mind that computers of this era need every ounce of RAM- max everything out, or it will be swapping 
to disk internally due to on-demand paging so much that you wont get anything done.


#### Mac OS9

OS9 capable systems usually had a 512MB Dimm slot somewhere.<br>
This would put them on -par with WinME, Win2k -and possibly low end WinXP systems(if added).

CodeWarrior Base (OS9) is used as a base (Borland had a working Graphics lib) starting point.<br>

DrawSprockets(pre-OSX) are preferred over QuickDraw/QuickDraw GX.<br>
When OS9 update QuickDraw for color modes(dodgy,hackish code) - the best performing was DrawSprockets.<br>
(The API merged into Quartz with OSX.)


#### Dos

Dos-Based systems generally dont connect to the internet.<br>
(You would be browsing in text mode if you were.)
    
        Again, Borland has a starting base , here.
