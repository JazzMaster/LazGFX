this is going to be rewritten for DGL/FContext +Lazarus
"Direct Rendered":


glClearColor3i(r,g,b)
glClear(COLOR_Buffer_BIT)

glModel(FLAT)

-- ModelView Matrix Mod for 2D -- (looking at side of a cube, head on)

glRect(x,y,w,h) [ocean]

Ship POLY:

glColor3i(r,g,b)
glbegin(GL_POLYGON)

    glVertex2i(x,y);
    glVertex2i(x,y);
    glVertex2i(x,y);
    glVertex2i(x,y);
    glVertex2i(x,y);
    glVertex2i(x,y);
    glVertex2i(x,y);
    glVertex2i(x,y);

glEnd()

glColor3i(r,g,b)

..next poly..

You will have halftone hash, more colors, blends, etc. now.
