I insist on LGPL version 2, if you dont like it, dont take my code.

REDHAT did this for the same reason Im doing it now:

		Share the code alike and BACKPORT changes.

If you dont backport, then DONT TAKE the CODE. 
You may FORK. 
You may rewrite it BACK INTO C/CPP/C sharp...PYTHON..(I dont care...)

LGPL is enclosed. 

THIS IS A LIBRARY.
Plan accordingly.

NO WARRANTY (IMPLIED, ASSUMED OR OTHERWISE).
YOUR MILEAGE WILL VARY.

You must cite original authors and sub authors, as appropriate(stand attribution rules).
DO NOT CLAIM THIS CODE AS YOUR OWN and you may not remove this notice.
